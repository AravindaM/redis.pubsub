## Usage

### Include in the project

```javascript
  var redisPubSub = require('redis.pubsub')([config [, options]])
```

  * __config__: `{ port || 6379, host || 'localhost', pass }`. `port`, `host` and `password` to connect to a Redis server.
  * __options__: Accepts all options for Redis' `createClient()` [method](http://github.com/mranney/node_redis#rediscreateclientport-host-options).

---
### Create an instance

```javascript
  // listener only
  var Sub = (new redisPubSub).Sub()

  // emiter only
  var Pub = (new redisPubSub).Pub()

  // instance can be a Publisher and Subscriber (emit and listen)
  // simply chain the above methods.
  var PubSub = (new redisPubSub).Pub().Sub()
```

---
### Set up an emiter

```javascript
  PubSub.emit(channel, message)
```

  * __channel__: Name of a publishing channel, e. g. `drain` or `drain.pipe` | defaults to `*`
  * __message__: Object to be published. Strings do not apply!.

---
### Set up a listener

```javascript
  var sub = PubSub.on(query, filter, callback = function (data, channel, pattern) {
    // process your data here
  })
```
  * __query__: query to filter messages. Supports mongoDB-like queries and regular expressions.
  TODO: queries description
  * __filter__: filter returned data by displaying only selected keys
  * __callback__: function to process returned `data` sent on a specific `channel` and captured by a listener `pattern`

  Function returns reference to subscription.

---
### Disable a listener

You can unsubscribe by:

```javascript
  // calling a reference object from when subscribing
  sub([callback])

  // or using the reference as a param (single or multiple as an array)
  PubSub.off(target[, callback])
```

  * __target__: reference to a subscription or an array of subscription objects
  * __callback__: optional

---
### Clear all queue filters aka reset

```javascript
  PubSub.clear([callback])
```

  * __callback__: optional

---
### Destroy the instance and Redis client

Method removes all subscriptions, clears the filter queue and removes the Redis client.

```javascript
  PubSub.cleanUp([callback])
```

  * __callback__: optional

##Example

```javascript
  // TODO: write this
```
